YanghoScript is a simple programming language with the ability to work with variables, arithmetic operations and display results. Was built for Vietnamese gangsters😎.

## Features

### Existing Features:

-   Assignment of values to variables
-   Arithmetic operations
-   Outputting results
-   Comment out a line of code

### Upcoming Features (Not Really Soon):

-   Conditional statements(Partially implemented)
-   Looping constructs
-   Functions
-   Error handling

## Installation

To get started with YanghoScript, you'll need Node.js. Download and install it from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

Then follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hoachnt/YanghoScript.git
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
cd YanghoScript
npm install
```

## Usage

After installation, you can use YanghoScript to execute programs written in this language. Open the `code.ys` file and write your YanghoScript code in it.

Example code:

```js
text BAYHETVAODAY 'Hoach';
summ BAYHETVAODAY 6 + 5;

NOILIENTUC text;
NOILIENTUC summ;

sumandmin BAYHETVAODAY summ - ((20 + 2) * 2);

NOILIENTUC sumandmin;
NOILIENTUC 'Chao ca lo nha minh nha';

NOILIENTUC 1 UY TIN 1;
NOILIENTUC 2 NHIEU HON 1;
NOILIENTUC 1 IT HON 2;
NOILIENTUC 1 NHIEU BANG 1;
NOILIENTUC 2 IT BANG 2;

NOILIENTUC 2 UY TIN 1;
NOILIENTUC 2 NHIEU HON 3;
NOILIENTUC 1 IT HON 0;
NOILIENTUC 1 NHIEU BANG 2;
NOILIENTUC 2 IT BANG 1;

NEU (2 UY TIN 1) {
    NOILIENTUC 'Yasuo';
} KO THI {
    NOILIENTUC 'Kosuo';
}

NOILIENTUC 'All Works!!!';

// NOILIENTUC 'Hello world' - comment
```

To run a program, use the following command in the terminal:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

Ensure that your code is written in the `code.ys` file.

## Code Structure

YanghoScript supports the following constructs:

-   Assignment of values to variables: `variable = value;`
-   Arithmetic operations: `+, -, *, /`
-   Use parentheses for correct order of arithmetic operations. For example, for the expression `1 + 2 * 3`, it should be written as `1 + (2 * 3)`.

Examples of correct expressions:

```javascript
1 + 2 * 3; // Result: 9(incorrect)
1 + (2 * 3); // Result: 7(correct)
10 / (2 + 3); // Result: 2(correct)
```

Using parentheses ensures the correct order of operations and prevents errors in calculations.

## Important

YanghoScript is in an early stage of development and may have some limitations and shortcomings. If you find any bugs or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to report them in the Issues section on [GitHub](https://github.com/hoachnt/YanghoScript).

Don't forget that YanhoScript is a joke programming language.
