### 🔍 Key Features

1. **🔒 Immutable File System**  
   VanillaOS uses an immutable system where core files are protected (read-only). This enhances both security and stability, reducing risks from misconfigurations or malware attacks.

2. **🛠️ Universal Package Manager `apx`**

    `apx` allows installing packages from multiple ecosystems in isolated containers, keeping your main system clean and conflict-free:

    - **apt** (Debian/Ubuntu)
    - **dnf** (Fedora)
    - **pacman** (Arch Linux)  
      This makes it easy to use software from any ecosystem without worrying about dependency issues.

3. **📦 Flatpak and AppImage Support**  
   Enjoy the latest software updates directly from developers, bypassing traditional package delays. This ensures you’re always using the most recent versions.

4. **🧩 Application Containerization**  
   Each app is sandboxed for better security. Even if an application is compromised, it won’t affect your entire system.

5. **🔄 Atomic Updates and Rollbacks**  
   Updates are performed atomically, meaning they’re either fully applied or not at all, preventing partial updates. If something goes wrong, you can easily roll back to a previous state.

6. **📱 Experimental Support for Android (APK) Apps**

    VanillaOS lets you run Android apps natively in isolated containers, allowing you to leverage mobile apps on your desktop without sacrificing security or performance.

7. **⚡ Minimalism and High Performance**  
   VanillaOS comes with a minimal set of pre-installed software, giving you a lean, efficient system that you can fully customize to fit your needs.
