I used to eagerly follow innovations in the frontend world. Every new framework, whether it was Angular, React, or Svelte, seemed like a step into the future. But over time, my perspective changed.

## The Main Reason

Constant and radical changes between versions. When you have a single project, this can even be excitingâ€”exploring new features, refactoring code, and trying fresh approaches. But when you have dozens of projects, the need for migration turns into a nightmare.

## Update Issues

Every update is not just about installing a new version. It involves:

- Testing
- Fixing broken code
- Adapting to new APIs

Sometimes, the changes are so significant that large parts of the application need to be rewritten. As a result, instead of developing new features, you spend time keeping old projects up to date.

## Stability and Predictability

I started valuing stability and predictability. Simple, time-tested technologies that rely minimally on external changes have become more appealing to me. Of course, innovation is important, but not when it turns your projects into an endless construction site.

### Vue as an Example of Stability

Interestingly, Vue has proven to be very stable since version 3. The API hardly changes, and new features can be smoothly integrated into projects without requiring a complete code overhaul. This makes it a good choice for those who want a balance between innovation and predictability.

## Conclusion

Maybe it's just fatigue. Or maybe it's the realization that technology should work for you, not the other way around.
