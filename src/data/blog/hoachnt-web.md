# 🌟 Technologies and Features of the Hoachnt web Project

## 📜 Project Description

The project was created using modern tools and technologies to ensure high performance, ease of development, and quality user interface. The main technologies used are:

-   **Nuxt 3** 🚀 — a framework for building web applications with server-side and client-side rendering.
-   **Nuxt UI** 🎨 — a set of components to speed up development and create a unified interface.
-   **TypeScript** 💻 — a programming language that adds static typing to JavaScript, promoting safer and more structured code.

## ⚙️ Main Features of the Project

### SEO (Search Engine Optimization) 🌐

To ensure high rankings in search results, the built-in SEO system in Nuxt 3 is used. The `useSeoMeta` function allows for dynamic setting of metadata for pages, improving the site's visibility in search engines.

### High Performance ⚡

To ensure high performance, optimizations at the Nuxt 3 level are utilized, such as:

-   server-side rendering (SSR) for fast content loading,
-   lazy loading of scripts and styles to reduce time to first paint.

### Code Organization 🛠️

To maintain code cleanliness and consistency, the following tools are used:

-   **ESLint** — for automatic checking and correction of code to meet standards,
-   **Prettier** — for formatting code according to specified rules (e.g., structure of `.vue` files).

### Multilingual Support 🌍

The project supports multiple languages, allowing for a broader audience reach. In Nuxt 3, modules like `@nuxt/i18n` can be used to easily manage translations.

### Smooth Animations 🎉

To enhance user experience and add visual appeal, smooth animations are employed. Tools like `@vueuse/motion` make it easy to add animations to Vue components and control their behavior.

### Minimalist Design ✨

The project adheres to minimalist design principles, improving usability and focusing attention on the main content. **Nuxt UI** and custom styles help create a clean and functional interface.

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates the application of modern technologies to create a fast, user-friendly, and visually appealing web application with high performance and good search engine optimization.
