## Apple and Sapper's Refusal

In the 1980s, impressed by Sapper's work, Steve Jobs tried to recruit him to work at Apple. Jobs believed that Sapper's talent was a perfect fit for the company, which was striving for design innovation. However, Sapper declined the offer, preferring to maintain his creative independence and continue his collaboration with IBM, where he had the freedom to realize his ideas without restrictions.

## Parallel with Dieter Rams

Although Richard Sapper and Dieter Rams represented different approaches to design, their works are often compared. Rams, known for his minimalism and "less, but better" principles, had a significant influence on Apple through his work at Braun, especially on the design of Jony Ive. Sapper, on the other hand, infused more dynamism and individuality into his projects, staying true to his philosophy of functional yet expressive design. Their work has shaped two important directions in industrial design that remain relevant today.

## Conclusion

Richard Sapper was not just a designer but a man whose work changed perceptions of functionality and aesthetics in industrial design. His refusal of Apple's offer only underscores his commitment to his principles and independence, which made his work legendary.
